# MIRACLE-MATLAB
MATLAB API for MIRACLE DevKit.

[Eridan MIRACLE DevKit](https://eridan.io/devkit/)

The **TX** repo contains MATLAB code intended to drive the MIRACLE TX.  Most of the files in this repo contain wrappers for the functions outlined in the **Using Serial Communication Terminal** section of the DevKit User guide.  These commands are sent as strings over a serial connection to the ZC706.

*Note: The existing code in the TX repo will be converted to a MATLAB class structure in the coming weeks.*

The **RX** repo contains a MATLAB script to control the AD9361 **RX ONLY** on the MIRACLE DevKit module. Please refer to the MIRACLE DevKit User Guide for more information.
