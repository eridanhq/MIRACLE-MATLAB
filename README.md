# MIRACLE-MATLAB
MATLAB API for MIRACLE DevKit.

[Eridan DevKit](https://eridan.io/devkit/)

This repo contains MATLAB code intended to drive the MIRACLE TX.  Most of the files in this repo contain wrappers for the functions outlined in the **Using Serial Communication Terminal** section of the DevKit User guide.  These commands are sent as strings over a serial connection to the ZC706.

*Note: The existing code in this repo will be converted to a MATLAB class structure in the coming weeks.*
